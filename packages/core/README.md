## What this package is for

`@specferret/core` is the runtime library behind the CLI. Use it when you want to embed SpecFerret behavior in scripts, custom tooling, or internal workflows.

It includes:

- Store implementations (`sqlite`, `postgres`)
- Frontmatter extraction and schema validation
- Reconciler logic for direct/transitive impact
- Context graph generation utilities

## Install

```bash
npm i @specferret/core
```

## Runtime requirements

- Bun 1.0+

SpecFerret core is Bun-first and uses Bun-compatible runtime behavior.

## Typical consumers

- Internal platform tooling that needs drift checks in-process
- CI wrappers that need machine-readable drift metadata
- Custom developer workflows on top of SpecFerret reconciliation data

## Validation status

Core behavior is validated through the Sprint 5 external branch-matrix harness (spec-kit + BMAD), including explicit assertions for:

- S40 transitive depth thresholds
- S41 review proof artifacts
- S42 extract determinism
